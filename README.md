# Robotics-Group-4

This project consists of four main Python scripts that control the robot
1.teleop_robot
2.look_around
3.pick_and_place
4.test


1. The teleop_robot file allows us to move the robot in the desired direction. That which allows as to get close to the targeted object.
2. The look_around file allows the robot to scan the surrounding area and when it detects abject of interest it locks onto it.
3. The pick_and_place file makes it so that when the robot has locked onto a target and has moved close enough, it can grip the object with its grippers.
4. Lastly the test file allows us to make use of those files and make them work together resulting in the final movement of the robot.
